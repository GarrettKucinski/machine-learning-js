# KNN Improvement Techniques

- Adjust parameters of analysis
  - maybe K is not right, or maybe out prediction point was just a little bit off
- add more features to explain the analysis
- change the prediction point
- Accept that maybe there isn't a strong correlation between our prediction and the data


## Measuring the accuracy of the algorithm

- gather a whole bunch of data, and split that data into two sets; one for training and one for testing our predictions
- for each record in the test data run KNN algo using the training data
